# Getting started

## How to Build

The generated SDK relies on [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) being available to resolve dependencies. If you don't already have NPM installed, please go ahead and follow instructions to install NPM from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
The SDK also requires Node to be installed. If Node isn't already installed, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> NPM is installed by default when Node is installed

To check if node and npm have been successfully installed, write the following commands in command prompt:
* `node --version`
* `npm -version` 
![Version Check](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=versionCheck&workspaceFolder=Calc-Node)  

Now use npm to resolve all dependencies by running the following command in the root directory (of the SDK folder):
* `npm install`
![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency1&workspaceFolder=Calc-Node)
![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency2)

This will install all dependencies in the `node_modules` folder. 

Once dependencies are resolved, you will need to move the folder `CalcLib ` in to your `node_modules` folder.

## How to Use

The following section explains how to use the library in a new project.

### 1. Open Project Folder
Open an IDE/Text Editor for JavaScript like Sublime Text. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.  
Click on `File` and select `Open Folder`
![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openFolder)

Select the folder of your SDK and click on `Select Folder` to open it up in Sublime Text. The folder will become visible in the bar on the left.
![Open Project](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openProject&workspaceFolder=Calc-Node)


### 2. Creating a Test File
Now right click on the folder name and select the `New File` option to create a new test file.    Save it as `index.js` Now import the generated NodeJS library using the following lines of code:
```JavaScript
var lib = require('lib');
```
Save changes.

![Create new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=createNewFile&workspaceFolder=Calc-Node)
![Save new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=saveNewFile&workspaceFolder=Calc-Node)

### 3. Running The Test File
To run the `index.js` file, open up the command prompt and navigate to the Path where the SDK folder resides. Type the following command to run the file:  
`node index.js`
![Run file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=Calc-Node)


## How to Test

These tests use Mocha framework for testing, coupled with Chai for assertions. These dependencies need to be installed for tests to run.
Tests can be run in a number of ways:

### Method 1 
###### (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the root directory of the SDK folder from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha --recursive` to run all the tests.

### Method 2
###### (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha *` to run all the tests.

### Method 3
###### (Run specific controller's tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha  CalcController`  to run all the tests in that controller file.

> To increase mocha's default timeout, you can change the `TESTTIMEOUT` parameter's value in `Configuration.js`.  
> ***NOTE:*** Changing default timeout is available for only Binary/File type endpoint tests

## Initialization

### 

API client can be initialized as following:

```JavaScript

var lib = require('lib');
```

## Class Reference

### <a name="list_of_controllers"></a>List of Controllers

* [SimpleCalculatorController](#simple_calculator_controller)

### <a name="simple_calculator_controller"></a>![Class: ](https://apidocs.io/img/class.png ".SimpleCalculatorController") SimpleCalculatorController

#### Get singleton instance

The singleton instance of the ``` SimpleCalculatorController ``` class can be accessed from the API Client.

```javascript
var controller = lib.SimpleCalculatorController;
```

#### <a name="get_calculate"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png ".SimpleCalculatorController.getCalculate") getCalculate

> Calculates the expression using the specified operation.


```javascript
function getCalculate(input, callback)
```
#### Parameters

| Parameter | Tags | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| operation |  ``` Required ```  | The operator to apply on the variables |
| x |  ``` Required ```  | The LHS value |
| y |  ``` Required ```  | The RHS value |



#### Example Usage

```javascript

    var input = [];
        input["operation"] = new OperationTypeEnum(SUM);
        input["x"] = 5;
        input["y"] = 5;

    controller.getCalculate(input, function(error, response, context) {

    
	});
```

#### Errors

| Error Code | Error Description |
|------------|-------------------|
| 412 | Could not compute the requested calculation |
